This tika-bundle is a repackaged Apache Tika OSGi that embeds the full set of OOXML schemas instead of the default POI OOXML subset.
The pom.xml is an altered pom.xml from the tika-bundle in the Apache Tika Project (https://github.com/apache/tika/blob/master/tika-bundle/pom.xml).
This is the OSGI solution to the workaround described in this ticket : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-2094


## Maintenance
 * When a new version of the tika-bundle is released, determine if the version of Apache POI was changed
   - If the version of POI has been changed, determine if the version of ooxml-schemas and ooxml-security have changed
 * Change the tika version to the new version
 * If the ooxml-schemas / ooxml-security versions have changed, update them appropriately
 * Determine if the pom.xml for the tika-bundle in the Apache Tika Project has changed
   - If yes, copy / paste the build section of the pom.xml
   - Replace poi-ooxml-schemas with ooxml-schemas and add ooxml-security to the <Embed-Dependency> section
